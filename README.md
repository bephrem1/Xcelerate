# Xcelerate

This application fetches data from the Quandl API and persists the data (after calculations of 1st and 2nd deltas between ticker dates in history) to MongoDB which will be used to build a model using predictive analysis to accurately forecast stock fluctuations without the use of external semantical analysis.

This is a team/personal project and possibly may not be fully on display in this repository.
